# Faux-Banking-App
An intermingling of SQL and Python3 which connects to Google's Cloud Platform where I created a database in MySQL and wrote a python script to act as a "banking application."

### Note: 
IP address & Host_name for MySQL connection will be different. You will also need to set up a database using SQL before running this python script. I've attached my simple table creating .sql file for reference.
